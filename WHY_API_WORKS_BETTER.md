# Why the API Approach Works Better

The API approach directly modifies GitHub's database by setting `source:null`, completely removing the parent-fork relationship. This is more reliable than changing visibility, which doesn't always trigger metadata refresh.

After using the API method, your repository will be truly standalone with only your contributions showing.
