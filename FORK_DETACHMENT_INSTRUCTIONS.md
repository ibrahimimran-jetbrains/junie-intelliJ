# Fork Detachment Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions to completely detach your repository from the original fork using GitHub's API.

## Step 1: Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "Fork Detachment"
4. Select the "repo" scope (this gives access to modify your repository)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately - you will only see it once!

## Step 2: Run the Detachment Script

1. Open a terminal in your repository directory
2. Run the script with your token:
   ```bash
   ./detach_fork.sh YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the token you copied in Step 1

## Step 3: Verify the Change

1. After running the script, wait a few seconds
2. Go to your repository on GitHub (https://github.com/ibrahimimran-jetbrains/junie-intelliJ)
3. Refresh the page
4. Verify that:
   - The "forked from spring-projects/spring-petclinic" label is gone
   - The contributors list now only shows your account

## Troubleshooting

If the fork relationship is still visible after running the script:

1. Try refreshing your browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Wait a few minutes - GitHub may take time to update the UI
3. If still not working, try the alternative method in ALTERNATIVE_SOLUTION.md

## Security Note

Delete your personal access token from GitHub after use if you don't need it for other purposes.
