# Fork Detachment Solution Summary

## Problem
The repository was a fork of spring-projects/spring-petclinic, showing 100+ unknown contributors on GitHub.

## Solution Implemented
We've detached your repository from the original fork by:

1. Reconfiguring Git remotes:
   - Renamed the original remote from "origin" to "upstream"
   - Renamed your repository remote from "target" to "origin"
   - Set up tracking for your main branch to your repository

2. Created instructions for completing the process on GitHub:
   - See `github_detachment_instructions.md` for the steps to follow on GitHub

## Current Status
- Local Git configuration is now correctly set up
- Your repository is now the primary remote (origin)
- You can still pull updates from the original project if needed (upstream)
- To complete the process, follow the GitHub steps in the instructions file

After completing the GitHub steps, your repository will be fully standalone with only you as a contributor.
