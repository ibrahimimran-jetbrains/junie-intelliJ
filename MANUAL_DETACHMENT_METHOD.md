# Manual Fork Detachment Method

If you prefer not to use the GitHub API, here's an alternative manual approach to detach your fork.

## Option 1: Create a New Repository

1. **Create a new empty repository on GitHub**
   - Go to GitHub → Click "+" in top-right → "New repository"
   - Name it as you wish
   - Set visibility (public/private)
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Push your existing code to the new repository**
   ```bash
   # Add the new repository as a remote
   git remote add newrepo https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NEW_REPO_NAME.git
   
   # Push all branches and tags
   git push newrepo --all
   git push newrepo --tags
   
   # Rename the new remote to origin
   git remote rename newrepo origin
   
   # Remove the old remotes
   git remote remove upstream
   ```

## Option 2: Contact GitHub Support

If neither the API method nor creating a new repository works:

1. Go to https://support.github.com/
2. Submit a request with the following information:
   - Subject: "Need to detach fork relationship"
   - Description: "I have a repository (URL: https://github.com/ibrahimimran-jetbrains/junie-intelliJ) that is showing as a fork of spring-projects/spring-petclinic. I've tried changing visibility settings and using the API to detach it, but I still see 100+ contributors from the original project. Please help me completely detach this fork relationship."
   - Category: "Repository"

GitHub support can manually remove the fork relationship from their database.
