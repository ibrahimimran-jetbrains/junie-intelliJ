# Fork Detachment Solutions

## Problem
Your repository is still showing 100+ contributors from the original project, indicating it's still recognized as a fork by GitHub.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: GitHub API Method (Recommended)
The most direct and reliable solution is to use GitHub's API to explicitly break the fork relationship:

1. Generate a Personal Access Token with "repo" scope
2. Use the API to set `source:null` in your repository metadata
3. This directly tells GitHub to remove the parent repository reference

See `COMPLETE_FORK_DETACHMENT.md` for detailed instructions.

### Option 2: Create a New Repository
If you prefer not to use the API:

1. Create a fresh empty repository on GitHub
2. Push your existing code to the new repository
3. Switch your local repository to use the new remote

See `ALTERNATIVE_SOLUTION.md` for detailed instructions.

### Option 3: Contact GitHub Support
If the above methods don't work:

1. Go to https://support.github.com/
2. Submit a request explaining that you need to detach your fork
3. Provide your repository URL and mention that you've tried changing visibility

## Why Previous Method Didn't Work
The previous approach (changing visibility temporarily) doesn't always trigger a complete metadata refresh in GitHub's database. The fork relationship is stored separately from visibility settings.

## Next Steps
1. Try Option 1 (API method) first
2. If that doesn't work, try Option 2 (new repository)
3. As a last resort, contact GitHub Support

After implementing any of these solutions, your repository should show only your contributions.
