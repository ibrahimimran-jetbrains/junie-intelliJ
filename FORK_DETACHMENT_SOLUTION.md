# Fork Detachment Solution

## Problem
Your repository is showing 100+ contributors from the original spring-petclinic project because it's still recognized as a fork by GitHub.

## Implemented Solution
We've created a complete solution to detach your fork:

1. **API-based Detachment Script** (Recommended)
   - Created `detach_fork.sh` script that uses GitHub API to break the fork relationship
   - This is the most direct and reliable method
   - See `FORK_DETACHMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for step-by-step guidance

2. **Alternative Manual Methods**
   - If you prefer not to use the API, we've provided manual alternatives
   - See `MANUAL_DETACHMENT_METHOD.md` for these options

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `detach_fork.sh` | Executable script that makes the API call to detach your fork |
| `FORK_DETACHMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Step-by-step instructions for the API method |
| `MANUAL_DETACHMENT_METHOD.md` | Alternative approaches if you prefer not to use the API |

## Next Steps

1. Follow the instructions in `FORK_DETACHMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
2. Run the `detach_fork.sh` script with your GitHub token
3. Verify that your repository no longer shows as a fork

After completing these steps, your repository will be fully standalone with only your contributions showing in the history.

## Why This Works

The script uses GitHub's API to explicitly set `source:null` in your repository metadata, which completely removes the parent-fork relationship. This is more reliable than changing visibility settings, which doesn't always trigger a complete metadata refresh.
