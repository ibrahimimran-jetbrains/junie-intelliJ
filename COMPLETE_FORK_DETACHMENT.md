# Complete Fork Detachment Solution

Since you're still seeing 100+ contributors, we need to use GitHub's API to completely detach your repository from the original fork.

## Solution: Use GitHub's API to Break the Fork Relationship

1. **Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name like "Fork Detachment"
   - Select the "repo" scope
   - Click "Generate token" and copy the token (you'll only see it once)

2. **Use the GitHub API to Break the Fork Relationship**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt
   - Replace placeholders in this command and run it:

```bash
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY \
  -d '{"name":"YOUR_REPOSITORY","private":true,"source":null}'
```

For example:
```bash
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ghp_abc123..." \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/ibrahimimran-jetbrains/spring-petclinic2 \
  -d '{"name":"spring-petclinic2","private":true,"source":null}'
```

3. **Verify the Change**:
   - After running the command, refresh your GitHub repository page
   - The "forked from" label should disappear
   - The contributors list should now only show your account

## Why This Works

The previous method of changing visibility temporarily didn't fully break the fork relationship in GitHub's database. Using the API with `"source":null` explicitly tells GitHub to remove the parent repository reference, completely detaching your fork.

This is the most reliable method to ensure your repository is truly standalone with only your contributions showing.
