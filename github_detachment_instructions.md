# GitHub Fork Detachment Instructions

To complete the detachment process and make your repository fully standalone:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub (https://github.com/ibrahimimran-jetbrains/junie-intelliJ)
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to the "Danger Zone" section
4. Click on "Change repository visibility" (this will trigger a refresh of repository metadata)
5. Don't actually change the visibility - just select the current visibility setting and confirm

This will force GitHub to refresh the repository metadata and remove the fork relationship. After this, your repository will be completely standalone with only you as a contributor.

## What We've Done So Far

We've already completed these steps:

1. Renamed the original remote from "origin" to "upstream"
2. Renamed your repository remote from "target" to "origin"
3. Set up tracking for your main branch to your repository

This configuration allows you to:
- Push/pull to your own repository as the primary remote
- Optionally pull updates from the original project using the upstream remote
